Different systems may use different no of bits to represent process id
and other things depending on the system.

For example one OS may use 32 bits for storing pid and other
may use 64 and in future systems may use 128 bits also.

When we write a portable program we need to use the datatypes in our
code which are defined according to the system on which we are going
to compile our C source.

All the primitive system datatypes are defined ( using typedef ) in
sys/types.h file.
